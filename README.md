## Desription
This application is a note taker app. When a user first enter our application's url, then they are presenting with a home screen with a 'get started' button. When it is clicked, you are presented with the application. When the user enters a title and text to the note, then are able to save the note into the server. Then the page is updated with the notes saved to the left. So if the user were to click on the any of the previous saved notes, then they that notes will be prompted on the screen on the title and text section. The also has the capability to delete the notes if they click the trash button that is next to the listed notes.

If you want to distingush if it is a saved note or a note ready to be saved, the saved notes will be in gray text. Meanwhile the notes that are ready to be saved have black text.
